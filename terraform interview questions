What is tfstate files:
  -Terraform.tfstate file contains information about proviosined infrasture managed by terraform
  -whenever we change the configuration file tfstate file determines which part of configuration is already created and which need to be changed
 
 Data Sources:
  -It allows terraform to use data defined outside of terraform, defined by another separate terraform configuration or modified functions.
  -data sources is accessed by using data resource, defined by "data"  block
  
 Dynamic block:
  -When ever we need to define same code multiple times, instead of copying the code we use dynamic blocks
  example:
      locals{
            ingress_rules=[{
            port = 80
            description = "enable 80 port"
            },
            {
            port = 8080
            description = "enable 8080 port"
            }]
           }
          resource "security_groups" "example"{
          name = "security_groups_for_dynamic_block"
          vpc_id = aws_vpc.....
          dynamic "ingress"{
              for_each = locals.ingress_rules
              content{
                  description = ingress.value.description
                  from_port = ingress.value.port
                  to_port = ingress.value.port
                  type = "tcp"
                  cide_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
                  }
                  }
                  }
     
     Null Resources:
     
      - null resorce implements the standard resource lifecycle but takes no further action
